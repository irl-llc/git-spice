Usage: gs branch (b) merge (m) [flags]

Merge a branch and its downstack

Merges the current branch and all branches below it into trunk via the forge
API, bottom-up. Use --branch to start at a different branch.

Already-merged branches are skipped automatically. Branches must have an open
Change Request to be merged. Between merges, the command waits for each merge
to complete and retargets the next PR to trunk. Use --no-wait to skip this and
merge without waiting.

After merging, run 'gs repo sync' to update local state.

Flags:
  --branch=NAME    Branch to merge
  --no-wait        Skip waiting for each merge to propagate before proceeding.

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
