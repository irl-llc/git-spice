Usage: gs branch (b) merge (m) [flags]

Merge a branch and its downstack

Merges the current branch and all branches below it into trunk via the forge
API, bottom-up. Use --branch to start at a different branch.

Already-merged branches are skipped automatically. Branches must have an open
Change Request to be merged. Between merges, the command waits for each merge
to complete and retargets the next PR to trunk. Use --no-wait to skip this and
merge without waiting.

Before merging, the downstack is checked for branches whose base PR was already
merged on the forge. Use --no-branch-check to skip this validation.

After merging, run 'gs repo sync' to update local state.

Flags:
  --branch=NAME        Branch to merge
  --no-wait            Skip waiting for each merge to propagate before
                       proceeding.
  --no-branch-check    Skip stale base validation before merging.

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
