Usage: gs ci merge-guard <number> [flags]

Block merging a PR whose base is not trunk

Checks whether a change request is safe to merge by verifying its base branch is
trunk.

Use this in forge CI/CD pipelines to prevent out-of-order merges in a stacked PR
workflow.

By default, only git-spice managed PRs are checked. Unmanaged PRs are allowed
through. Use --all to block any PR whose base is not trunk.

The trunk branch is detected from the git-spice navigation comment on the PR.
Use --trunk to override this detection.

Exit codes:

    0  PR is safe to merge (base is trunk, or unmanaged)
    1  PR should not be merged yet

Arguments:
  <number>    Change request number to check

Flags:
  --trunk=STRING    Override trunk branch name
  --all             Block all non-trunk-based PRs, not just git-spice managed
                    ones

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
