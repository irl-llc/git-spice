## <a name="v0.24.0">v0.24.0</a> - 2026-02-22

We are renaming the 'gs' binary to 'git-spice'
to avoid conflicting with other command line tools.

This release is a compatibility release to ease the transition.
In this release, both binary names are available in
GitHub Release archives, the official Homebrew Cask,
and the AUR binary package:

- 'git-spice': the new name for the binary
- 'gs': deprecated, will print a warning on every invocation
  unless `GIT_SPICE_NO_GS_WARNING=1` is set in the environment

If you prefer using the name 'gs',
we recommend adding an alias to your shell configuration:

```bash
alias gs='git-spice'
```

The 'gs' binary will be removed in an upcoming release.
We encourage users to switch to 'git-spice' as soon as possible
to avoid disruption when the 'gs' binary is removed.

### Changed
- Rename 'gs' binary to 'git-spice'.

### Added
- Keep `gs` as a compatibility alias in GitHub Release archives,
  the official Homebrew Cask, and the AUR binary package for this release.
